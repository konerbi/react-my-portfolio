Going back to my first fascinations with the digital universe, I was always interested in the combination of technology and art. The front-end development allows me to combine both of these aspects through programming and working with graphics.</p><p>Apart from my professional interests, I have several other hobbies. Overall, I love creating SOMETHING out of nothing. Plastic kit modelling, jewellery making, and drawing with pencils, crayons, and ink, are my favourite ways to express myself. Besides, I enjoy playing the guitar, fishing with a rod and travelling.</p><p>If you want to know some more &ndash; please check out my <a href='src/assets/documents/KonradErbetowski_CV.pdf' download=\"KonradErbetowski_CV.pdf\"><b>CV</b></a>.</p>"
